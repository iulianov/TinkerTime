All you have to do is enter the URL to the mod webpage, and Tinker Time will do the rest of the work for you.  It will even manage your ModuleManager Installation for you. :)\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n- [Java 7](https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp) or better\r\n  - OpenJDK is not supported, but it may work\r\n\r\n#### Supported Mod Hosting Sites\r\n- Curse\r\n- Github (when compiled assets are released)\r\n- KerbalStuff\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\nPlease download the latest version from [KerbalStuff](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/243)\r\n\r\n### Wiki\r\nThe [Tinker Time Wiki](https://github.com/oharaandrew314/TinkerTime/wiki) contains many useful resources with instructions and known issues.\r\n\r\n### Special Thanks\r\n- Contributors ([apemanzilla](https://github.com/apemanzilla), [grossws](https://github.com/grossws))\r\n\r\n- Beta Testers ([foonix](https://github.com/foonix), [jcsntoll](https://github.com/jcsntoll), and [apemanzilla](https://github.com/apemanzilla))\r\n\r\n### Change Log\r\n\r\n##### v2.0 (planned)\r\n\r\nThis major update is planned to feature a visual design overhaul, and .version file integration\r\n\r\n##### v1.3\r\n\r\nThis update focuses on fixing annoyances, in order to provide a better general UX.\r\nA major refactor was done, reducing lines of code by an estimated 25%.\r\n\r\n###### LEGACY BREAKING CHANGES:\r\n- All configuration and mod data will not carry over to this version\r\n  -
